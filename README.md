About the Project
The detection of brain tumors is a critical task in the field of medical imaging, as it can significantly impact patient outcomes. However, accurately detecting brain tumors can be challenging due to the complex nature of the human brain and the variability in the appearance of tumors. Therefore, there is a need for an automated and accurate brain tumor detection system that can assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing brain tumors.
